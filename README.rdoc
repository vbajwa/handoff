Handoff is a basic electronic medical record application which allows you to track your patients for the day.

It was built using ruby on rails.

This application has two models, patients and diagnoses. It allows you to assign the same diagnosis to multiple patients, and to view all patients with a diagnosis. You can also add diagnoses and patients to the database, and edit accordingly.

Still to do: Styling is first on the list. For boolean values in the patient page, I'd change those to radio buttons/ T/F buttons.
